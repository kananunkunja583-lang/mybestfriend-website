  <h1>Our story, this year</h1>

  <p class="story-intro">
    This year wasn’t just about time passing. <br>
    It was about showing up — even when things felt heavy, <br>
    uncertain, or unfinished.
  </p>

  <!-- Chapter 1: The Year -->
  <section class="story-chapter">
    <p class="story-text">
      When I look back, I don’t see one clear path.
      I see effort. I see patience.
      I see us trying, even when we didn’t have all the answers.
    </p>

  <!-- Chapter 2: The Business -->
  <section class="story-chapter">
    <p class="story-text">
      One of the bravest things you did this year
      was starting your own business.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      It wasn’t easy. There were long days, doubts,
      and moments where everything felt uncertain.
      But you didn’t stop.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      We’re still working to keep it going.
      Still believing in it.
      And I’m so proud of you for that.

      In between all the serious moments,
      we found ways to laugh.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Game nights that went on longer than planned.
      Karaoke nights where the singing didn’t matter —
      only the laughter did.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Those nights reminded me that joy doesn’t need permission.

      We celebrated birthdays this year.

      Not perfectly. Not loudly.

      The kind of celebration that feels better than any party.

      Solfest was one of those moments
      where everything else disappeared.

    <p class="story-text">
      Music. Noise. Lights.
      And us — completely in the moment.

      We traveled.

      Thika gave us quiet.
      Time to slow down and breathe.

    <p class="story-text">
      Nairobi gave us energy.
      Movement, excitement, and life.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Different places —
      same feeling.
      Being okay, just being there together.

      When I think about this year,
      I don’t remember every detail clearly.

    <p class="story-text">
      But I remember how it felt.
      And most of all,
      I remember you.

      That feels like enough.
